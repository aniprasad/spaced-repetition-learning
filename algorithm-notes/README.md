## 💡 Usage Tips

1. **Quick Reference:** Navigate to specific pattern when stuck on similar problems
2. **Code Templates:** Copy and adapt implementations for practice
3. **Pattern Recognition:** Study examples to identify recurring techniques
4. **Cross-References:** Link patterns between categories for deeper understanding
5. **Personal Notes:** Add your own discoveries and optimizations

## 🎯 Integration with SRL

Reference these notes in your SRL problem notes:
```bash
srl add "Binary Tree Traversal" 4 --note "Used iterative inorder from /algorithm-notes/trees/traversals.md"
```
